## Project Overview
The Smart Parking System automates the management of parking spaces and calculates parking charges based on the duration of parking.
-**Parking Slot Management**: Tracks parking slot availability and assigns vehicles to slots. Each slot has a status (available or occupied).
-**Vehicle Tracking**: Records vehicle entry and exit times, and the vehicle type (car or bike).
-**Triggers**: Automatically updates slot availability when vehicles enter or exit.
-**Charge Calculation**: Calculates parking charges based on the vehicle's duration of stay and type (car or bike). Cars are charged $10 per hour, and bikes are charged $5 per hour.
